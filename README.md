# Overview - 
Matching a harvested liver to a patient is a huge problem. Many softwares exsist in the market to solve this problem.
We are trying to simulate how the matching works. It is based on many health factors like alcohol content and age.

# Components - 
## OOP_Project - 
This directory contains the code in the **src** directory. This code contains classes for hospitals and patient data.
The driver code is the main code that should be run to simulate the liver matching process. Rest all extra files and directories that got created while working in eclipse.
They could be added to gitignore to remove.

## Oops_JavaFX - 
This directory contains the code in the **src/fxui** directory. The main code is present in **ui.java**. This code should be run for the frontend part.
It displays fields which will be filled by user for the matching process. The user will enter fields with data of the patient.

## Diagram - 
It contains the UML diagram that can be used to understand the flow of the project.
